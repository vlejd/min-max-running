I am personally very reserved towards personal trainers. The reason is evolutionary. 
Trainers are paid per the amount of sessions they have with their client.
This creates an environment, that optimzes for bad things and lead to bad consequences for you as a new runner and there is not a lot of forces to correct it.
End of story.

They are not paied for results, they are not payed for how much they help you, nor how fast they do it. Quite the contrary!

Most people get a trainer to get them to train at the first place. That is a good start and training with a trainer is much better than no training at all. 
However your end goal forshould be to like training. To train as a habbit. To want to train (this may sound like a fantasy, but it is possible). You should defintely want to get to a point, where you can train on your own.

That is directly against the coach's interests. If you start training on your own, they dont get the money. 
Note, that coaches do not need to do this conciously. There does not need to be a large scale evil conspiracy. 
There is just a bunch of behhaviours that get self-selected by this process and that are bad for you.

Examples:
- making the training too complex: You have 15 exercises that change every session with random variations, numbers of repitions and sets. It makes you to think, that you need the trainer, because there is definitely some deep logic behind all those numbers.
-       Ofthen there is very little of it.
        Trainer asks you to do a ton of complex movements, only for a few sessions. There is no way for you to learn the technique properly. Improvement is limited, you continue to admire the trainer and your progress is questionable.
        On the other hand, the most effective exercises I know of are extremely simple. Because consistency is the key!
- making the training too hard and demanding: After the training you are drained. Maybe even a day after that. Now training is even less appealing to you. It can even become scary.
        If it is this demanding, you obviously need a trainer, because there is obviously a high chance of injury. On the other hand, you can actualy feel good about the trainer. The training is obviously doing something!
        Look at all the sweat and muscle soarnes! Money well spent! Well, that is just bullshit. It is much more usefull to maintain a steady, manageable progress than to overtrain and burn out.
- requiring special equipment: This is hopefully obvious. If your training is tied to something only your trainer has, you are completely dependent on them and there is way for you to get independent. 
- not tracking progress / making it hard to do so: You should not stress yourself with "goals". Those are just numbers. Lets do these random bodyweight exercises instead. Prefferably the ones, that you can cheat with poor form.
        Like a plank! An amazining core exercise (joking asside, it is), that is almost impoosible to do properly if you dont already have a decet core strength. You can do plank in really dumb ways.
        How are you improving based on time is tricky, because bad technique can make your time artificially larger. Luckilly, this is not that big of a deal in running. There are 2 clear numbers, that are integral parts of the sport:
        time and distance. So it is very easy to track the progress. Just dont forget to actually do it!

Your trainar may do these things without any bad faight. They can genuinely believe, it will be good for you (which makes it even more problematic).
It is just that trainers that do them (even by chance) will automatically earn more money despites making it worse for they customers.
There is not many forces against it. People that look for a trainer do it because they dont know how to train, so they do not reallyze the consequences.
And the cycle reinfoces itself.


So are trainer pointless, evil idiots? No. Despites all of the above, they can be very usefull. 
Sometimes, there are problems that you dont know how to solve. Sometimes there are things, that you do systematically wrong. Sometimes, you are missing a key training component. Somettimes something hurts is a strange way.
In those cases, I found it very helpfull to check on with an experienced trainer. 

The social apect also helps a lot. All of a sudden, you wil get someone that is interested in your training (even though it is for money). You may even meet a few people thanks to that. 
Together you can talk about your absurdly complex training routines, and there is a lot of content to go through. 
On the other hand, if you just said: I did these 3 exercises for X sets with Y reppetitions, the conversation could be very brief.
