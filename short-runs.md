## Running casually

It is important to not go all out.
Long run is a series of short runs.
It is infeasible to train marathon by running marathons.
Instead you can see Marathon or any other long run as a series of short runs. In this case, eight 5km long runs, or four 10 km long ones. The last 2.vhatever km are just a victory sprint. The adrenaline will carry you there.

Let's look at them in isolation, and from the end. So lets consider eight 5km long etaps.

How should you look like at the end of the 8th, last etap? Well, it does not really matter. As long as you have not caused yourself any permanent injury, you are free to be dehydrated, drained of energy and in craps.
There is nothing really stopping you from going all out here and push your self to the limit. After you crossed the finish line, it is done and there could be no tomorrow.
It seems to me, that most people train like this. The training is good only if you destroy yourself and you really felt you trained.

What about the seven previous etaps? Well, you definitely can not do the same. If you go all out, there is still that 8th etap waiting for you. You can not escape it. So for the remaining seven etaps you CAN NOT go all out.
By simple yet pointless math you should use one eight of your "effort". Whatever it means.

Unless you are an elite runner, "eight of a full effort" is not something that can be easyly imagined. Instead, what if you could run one etap with minimal effort.
Somehow run the etap, so you would feel exactly the same way before it as you would after it.
This is a much more sustainable strategy.

It turns out it is also something that could, and should be trained. 
It sound counterintuitive and against all the trainings you probably ever received, witnessed or imagined. 
Running a small etap without geting tired sounds pointless or even impossible. 
Maybe you heard this rummor about people that start the day by running and not only the continue the rest of the day without dying, they even claim to be energized.

From our simple math at the beginning it should be obvious that beeing able to run an etap without it having a lot of impact on you is much more usefull that being able to run an etap all out. Precisely 7 times more usefull. 

The claim that is unbelievable is that it can be done and that if you train like this at least a part of your training, you will still progress. 
Turns out, all you need is to track your progress, and have a watch (smart watch is not neccesery, but much more convennient) and you will be fine and surprised. 
The hardes think about this training is, that the whole time you will feel like you are not moving. 
There will be no imediate revard for your effort. You will only see it at the end of a training. 

The best feeling to have at an end of a short run is a combination of 2 things: 1) damn, why I had to do it so slow and end so early 2) how the hell is this longer and faster than my last week run?!?!?
Can you imagine having this feeling at the end of a Marathon? 


## Experimentation

Running has a let of variables that can be controlled. Sometimes they are important, somethis they are not. Sometimes they are specific to you, sometimes they are not. 
The only way to find out is to test it. Shor runs are perfect for this.

Because they are short and leave you with a large reserve at the end, they can stomach a lot of problems.
If something is causing you problems over the course of a short run, you will feel bad at the end. Only bad is manageable and has a high chance of not doing any permanent damage. 
If you do an experiment on a long run, the badness will compound and you could end up feeling extra horrible. It looks like a lot of potential damage is aquired exponentialy (or at least superliearly) 
and healed linearly. 

Here are some examples: 
If you buy new shoes, you can go for a short run. The shoe is definitely different and your body is not used to it yet. Some strange muscles can get sore, maybe you will have small knee pain. 
In the worst case your fingers will get a little sore. You will probably recover in a day. Maybe your body will adjust, maybe your shoes will get more playable, and maybe you will have to switch them for another pair.
But you are unlikely to screw yourself too much.

If you buy new shoes, you can also go for a long run. You will get all the problems that you would in a short run and then it goes downhill very fast. Sore fingers can turn into blisters or even bloddy wounds.
Sore muscles turn into strained muscles and the knee pain may take a few days to disapear. 
At this point there is hopefully still no permanent damage. But the time to recover may be large enough to screw with your training plan. 

The possitive thing is, that you can test almost anthing. If your run is short enough, you will probably not cause permanent damage to yourself unless you repeat the test more than neccesery. 
Common experiments to consider are: new articles of clothes, different time of the day, eating/drinking new stuff in new quantities, adding additional training, going for a more experimental route, listening to music, skipping or adding a warmup,
experimenting with new technique, experimenting with alcoho, experimenting with speed, experimenting with breading, experimenting with posture, vigorous stretching.
