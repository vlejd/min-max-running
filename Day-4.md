Congratulation on running 3 days in a row. 
The plan for today is no training. Yes, you can not train today. No running, no swimming and definitely no weightlifting.
I mean it. Make a plan to specifically not train. Instead you could read a book, watch some videos about running, have fun with your friends, call your loved ones or just be happy that you ran 3 days in a row. Just don't train. 

This is very important. Proper rest after training is the most important part of the training. 
You could argue, that you have been resting for your whole life until you started reading this text. 
However, now you are resting **after training**. See the subtle difference?

Resting is important to enable your body to recover after effort, build, and prepare for more effort in the future. 
It allows the body to literally rebuild the tissue, grow more muscle, replenish your energy and reset your nutrients. 
It prevents injuries, prevents bad feeling towards running, keeps your moral high and gives you time to live your life.
You may even get to the state that you will need to force yourself to not run on a rest day. It may feel completely impossible, but it will happen. 

Resting is so important that you can beat your "athletic" childhood friends by doing it. 
You probably know someone like that. They were very actively playing sports during school days, training like crazy, until they eventually had some injury. 
Now their knees and back are all messed up, and they are stuck in their glory days. 
You can be better then this by doing nothing. 

For a full disclosure, there are some more fancy ways how to rest called "active recovery". We will go through some of them, but they do not matter for now. 

Go and **do not train**!
Bye.
