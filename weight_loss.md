Running is often recommended as a good exercise for weight loss. That is almost like recommending chess as a form of weightloss.
Grandmaster chess players were obsertved to loose a lot of weight during high stakes tournaments (ref). However a more casual chess player will hardly get in shape over a chessboard. Notable mention to chessboxing, which will probably get the job done, but this text does not have much more opinions about this sport.

But you could say: "Most runners look very fit, thin and definitely not overweight". Well, a) wellcome to survivor bias b) devil is in the details.

First of all, wight loss is in esence an extremly simple equation. Weigh difference is proportional to the callory deficit you have. AKA, if you burn more calories than you ingest, you will loose weight. 
There is a lot of nuances, hacks and uncertainties about each part of that equation, but the equation itself is pretty much a physics law.

Running will burn calories, as any other activity, even chess. The question is how much, and how fast. Luckily, it is much easier to estimate this for running, than for chess. 

So how does it work? Food contains usable energy as chemical bonds in proteins, fats and sugars. It is a bunch of carbons, hydrogens and oxygens. You take those molecules, release the chemical energy, use the chemical energy to produce motion and heat and excrete the rest in form of CO2, H2O and poop.
Breathing is esentialy the same as cars exhaust (ref). 

Fun consequence of this is, that how much callories you burn is proportional to how much CO2 you breath out (ref). Which also makes a lot of physical activities asociated with weight loss to be comparable. 1 hour of running is similar to 1 hour of swimming which is similar to 1 hour of biking, 
if you have similar levels of exertion (similar breathing). (ref)

So lets do the math.
If you wight 100kg, and do aroung 5k steps a day, without other physical activity, you burn roughly 2300-2600 kcal per day. So if you eat 2300-2600 kcal a day, you will maintain your weight. (ref)
Internet has a lot of calculators that to a decent job at those estimates. (ref)

100 g of fat has roughly 600 kcal. (ref)
If you weight 100kg, you are burning roughly 100 kcal each kilometer of moderate running. (ref)
So you need to run roughly 6 km to loose roughly 0.1 kg. This only works if you keep the rest of your caloric intake exactly the same as you would have without running. 

On the other hand, you could could eat only half of a pizza for dinner instead of the full pizza, and you will get the exact same effect. (ref)
If you need to loose weight, it is much, much easier (and probably safer) to share a meal with someone every day, compared to running 6km, especially if you want to do it every single day!

You can get to a state where you can actually run 6 km every day. But it takes some training and time. 18 weeks of training, if you start as pretty fit individual. 
6 km a day is 42 km per week. That is a whole marathon worth of running. This level of fitness is equivalent to casually running a half marathon as a part of a normal training week. 

It is definitely doable, but it is a pretty shitty advice to someone who wants to loose wight and probably havent done a lot of running recently. 

However, if you continue to train, you can very well get to this level and even beyond that. This training plan peaks at 65 km week. that 1 kg of weight loss worth of calories. that is really good and around the upper limit of what weightloss is actually advisable. 
at the same time, this whole training plan consists of 910 km of running. That is 15kg!!!t That is a pretty good.

A litle side note. Running is very good at depleating your livers glycogen storage. (ref) When you finish a run, you can have very strong urge to eat. At that moment you increase your callory intake. All these weight loss numbers assume, that gou do not change your calory intake. If you get hungry and eat more, it kind of defeats the point of the weight loosing effort.

To conclude: 
- Does running burn calories? yes. 
- Is running efficient way of burning callories? Yes, but you need to run 6km a day.
- Will a person who needs to loose weight actually loose weight by running? Not really, especially in the beginning. 
- Is it good advice to someone who wants to loose weight? No.
- Can you train to a point where you can loose substantial amount of weight by running? Definitely.
