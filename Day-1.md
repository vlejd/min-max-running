Running a marathon is not a question of will, determination, bravery or physical capabilities.
It is a question of identity. Who you will become?
A person that wants to run? That is pretty easy and a little pointless, as it does not imply any running.
Or will you become a runner? Runner is a person who runs. Person who runs is a runner.

People have a lot of assumptions about what does it mean to be a runner.
The only core truth is that runner is someone who consistently goes for a run. 
Everything else follows from that.
Any training plan starts with you going for a run.
Any gear is good only if you usi it to run.
To achieve any running results, well you need to run.

It does not really matter how fast a runner runs or what distance they can run. 
As long as you are a runner, you can become faster, you can last longer but you need to run.

So you became a runner. Is it true? Go for a slow, short run now. 
Nothing else matters. Even not running does not matter. 
Just transport your self a short distance. 

If possible, aim for 1 km. If not, less is fine as well. 
Slow means that you can speak while doing so, and even after you are done.
This should take you between 3 min and 12 min based on your level of fitness. 
Do it SLOWLY. If you will have any negative consequences the next day, it was too fast. 

Most things commonly associated with running don't matter at this point, besides some hopefully obvious extremes. 

- rational behind this does not matter, just for now
- distance does not matter, as long as it is not zero 
- speed does not matter, as long as it is a short slow run
- the fact that it is short and slow does not matter, especially in the long run
- technique does not rally matter, as long as you are not deliberately trying to hurt yourself
- gear does not matter, as long as you are not freezing to death
- weather does not matter, as long as it is safe to go outside
- shoes do not matter
- time of the day does not matter
- surrounding does not matter, as long as they are safe
- having heart monitor does not matter, as long as you don't have some serious heart condition
- reading more of this book does not matter
- choosing the right music does not matter
- running alone / with someone does not matter
- warmup does not matter
- building muscles does not matter
- preventing chafing does not matter 
- sleep does not matter as long as you are not hallucinating
- water doe not matter, as long as you are not dehydrated
- food does not matter, as long as you are not fainting from malnutrition
- motivation does not matter, as long as you have at least some
- goals do not matter, as long as you have at least some
- approval from your surrounding does not matter
- indoor vs outdoor does not matter
- road vs track vs treadmill does not matter
- money does not matter
- your training history does not matter
- your race does not matter
- your religion does not matter
- your gender does not matter
- your ego does not matter

All of these things will matter eventually. But they do not matter now.
Only thing that matters is that you go for a slow run today, preferably right now.
See you tomorrow.
