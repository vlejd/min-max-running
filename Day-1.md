The first thing to build is consistency. You need to consistently train for running. Any plan starts with you going for a run.
Go for a slow, short run now. Nothing else matters. Even not running does not matter. Just transport your self a short distance.

Short means 1 km.
Slow means that you can speak while doing so, and even after you are done.
This should take you between 5 min and 12 min based on your level of fitness. 
Do it SLOWLY. 

Most things commonly associated with running don't matter at this point. 

- rational behind this does not matter, just for now
- distance, pace, time: does not matter, as long as it is a short slow run
- the fact that it is short and slow does not matter, especially in the long run
- technique does not rally matter; walk/run as you would normally do
- gear does not matter, as long as you are not freezing to death
- weather does not matter, as long as it is safe to go outside
- shoes do not matter
- time of the day does not matter
- surrounding does not matter, as long as they are safe
- having heart monitor does not matter, as long as you don't have some serious heart condition
- reading more of this book does not matter
- choosing the right music does not matter
- running alone / with someone does not matter
- warmup does not matter
- building muscles does not matter
- preventing chafing does not matter 
- sleep does not matter as long as you are not hallucinating
- water doe not matter, as long as you are dehydrated
- food does not matter, as long as you are not fainting from malnutrition
- motivation does not matter, as long as you have at least some
- goals do not matter, as long as you have at least some
- approval from your surrounding does not matter
- indoor vs outdoor does not matter
- road vs track vs treadmill does not matter
- money does not matter
- your training history does not matter

All of these things will matter eventually. But they do not matter now.
Only thing that matters is that you go for a slow run today, preferably right now.
Bye.
