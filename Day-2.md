Congratulations on finishing your day 1. If you didn't, just go back and try again.

Day 2 is the same as day 1. Go for a slow, short run. 1 km at pace between 5 and 12 min. If you can do it under 8.5 min, it is perfect, but it does not matter now. Do you think it is too little and you want to run for longer? Good. Hold that feeling and run 1 km.

Why most of the things don't matter? Because all of them need to be put into practice. So putting things into a practice is the most important skill to learn. That means going for a run. Can be short, can be slow, but you have to do it. 

The important thing we are building here is consistency. Tu become a runner, you need to run. DUH. So your training should enable you to run. 
At the beginning the biggest obstacle to running is not running. Second obstacle is to not cardinally mess up something, mainly to not get  injured.

For now, we addressed it by running for a short distance at a slow pace. 

You can find 12 minutes during your day. For 12 minutes you can survive in almost any weather, you don't need to eat, you don't need to drink, your clothes do not matter, and it should be pretty hard to hurt yourself unless you deliberately try.

Go for a short, slow run.
Bye.
