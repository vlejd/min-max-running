Congratulations on finishing your day 2. If you didn't, wait a day and go back to Day 1. I am not kidding.

You managed to get together 2 days of training. That is very good. It does not sound like much, but it is the first level at which we can speak about consistency. 

Day 3 is the same as day 2 and day 1. Go for a slow, short run. 1 km at pace between 5 and 12 min. If you can do it under 8.5 min, it is perfect, but it does not matter now.

At this point, you should start getting annoyed by this program. It is too slow, too "empty", and not motivational enough. Good, you are not annoyed by running.

Now you can ran a boring kilometer tree days in a row. Imagine you could run a boring kilometer at the end of a 42.195 km run. Wouldn't that be great? Please remember that. We are training for exactly that one kilometer.

Go for a short, slow run.
Bye.
